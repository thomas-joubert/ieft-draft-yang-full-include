        <t>
            YANG lacks reusability of defined models oustide of the grouping
            and augmentation mechanism. For instance, it is almost impossible
            to reuse a model defined for a device in the context of the the
            network, i.e by encapsulating it in a list indexed by device IDs.
            YANG mount (RFC8528) solves the problem by allowing to include
            schemas at deploy or runtime. This document aims to provide the
            same mechanism at design time.

        <t>
            RFC8528 introduces the challenge of reusing YANG models in a different
            context than the ones planned by the original owner. We focus here on
            the first use case identified in RFC8528, that is inserting modules at
            compile time.

            The full include mechanism defined in this document completes the use
            cases presented in RFC8528, providing a mechanism to support insertion
            of modules at compile time.

            <name>Definition</name>
            <t>
                The "full-include" statement (defined in the "ietf-yang-full-include" module) can appear as a substatement of the following statements:
            </t>
            <ul>
                <li>container</li>
                <li>list</li>
            </ul>
            <t>
                The "full-include" statement takes as an argument an identifier, refering to an imported module. Modules can contains
                multiple uses of the "full-include" statement. The "container" and "list" statements MAY contain multiple uses
                of the "full-include" statement on the same level, as long as they refer to different imported modules.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section>
            <name>Included Data Nodes Path Adjustment</name>
            <t>
                In the case of the call to a "leafref" statement, one must be able to specify the path of a leaf, even through a module passed as an argument to a "full-include" statement.
                The paths of the nodes contained in the module (refered in the following paragraph as "the included nodes") used in a "full-include" statement are computed as follows.
                TODO: explain how the path are computed, which basically boils down to concatenating the main module path with the included one ?
